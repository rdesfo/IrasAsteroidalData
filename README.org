In 2011 I was fortunate enough to be awarded the Maine Space Grant.
This repo is an attempt of organizing the material for the project.

** Poster

The poster folder contains the tex files needed to generate my poster for [[https://aas.org/taxonomy/term/447/feed][AAS 218]]
as well as the poster itself.

** In retrospect

Going back over the files years later I really wish I had used something like 
[[https://github.com/anishathalye/git-remote-dropbox][git-remote-dropbox]] to manage my files.  I had created many versions of files
and moved them in and out of the dropbox folder so that I could compare changes
as well as have additional control over files while collaborating.  Being able to
use git locally and pushing to dropbox to collaborate with the rest of the group
would have been a huge plus.
